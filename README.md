# Space Cats
Take the role of Clementine the cat, collect resources, farm crops, craft items and repair your space ship. Your goal is to fly to the moon and visit Eclipse, your girlfriend who you miss dearly.

This is a game I worked on over Spring and Summer 2024. I am horrified to notice it didn't have a github until now. (2026)
